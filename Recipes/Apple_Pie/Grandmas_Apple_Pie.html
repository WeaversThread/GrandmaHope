    <h2>How to Make Apple Pie</h2>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

    <h3>Apple Pie Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
      <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Apples for Apple Pie</h3>
    <p>This recipe calls for Granny Smith apples because their firmness holds up during baking and their tartness balances the sweetness. You can also blend with sweeter apples like Honeycrisp for variety.</p>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Peel, core, and slice the apples. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour to form a paste. Cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add both sugars and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 3–5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll and cut the second pastry into 8 strips.</li>
      <li>Place apples in the bottom crust. Form a lattice crust with the strips.</li>
      <li>Gently pour the sugar-butter mixture over the lattice crust and apples. Brush some on the top crust carefully.</li>
      <li>Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350°F and bake for another 35–45 minutes until apples are soft and crust is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How Long to Bake Apple Pie</h3>
    <p>Start baking at 425°F for 15 minutes, then lower to 350°F and continue for 35–45 minutes. It’s ready when apples are tender and crust is golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Does Apple Pie Need to Be Refrigerated?</h3>
    <p>Store cooled pie tightly covered at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 4 days.</p>

    <h3>Can You Freeze Apple Pie?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Wrap in 2 layers of plastic wrap and 1 layer of foil. Place in an airtight container or add another layer of foil. Freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
